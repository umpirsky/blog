title: Finding the Focus in the Age of Distraction
---

One of the biggest problems in a hyperconnected world we live in is constant **distraction**. Usually caused by social media easily accessible on smartphones. It's highly addictive and brings false sense of connection. It usually leads to decreased productivity, has negative effects on **mental health** and could even lead to symptoms of depression.

## The Problem

Admit it or not, we all have it to some extent. The fact that you are reading this article now, means that either you or someone you care about is having this problem, or you just consume the content that someone shared with you.

As the number of internet users grows, grows the number of content creators, there are a number of websites that offer user-created content of many kinds. It sounded like a good idea, it still is, one of the best examples is probably [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). But since the growth was fast, and many of us were not ready or educated to cope with all this information overload available, we started to consume whatever seemed interesting, **mindlessly scroll** through social media as a daily life routine, always hungry for more.

Curiosity, the hunger, thirst, desire, need for knowledge and the exploration of the unknown is built into our DNA. It came natural that we want to explore the vast of information and content that was suddenly lying under our fingertips.

Same applies to content creation. We are social beings, we love to share, and technology allowed us to be able to **share** like never before. What was the privilege of a few, became available to the masses. Ordinary man was suddenly able to reach millions in a heartbeat.

The addiction builds up quickly, as we discover more, we want more. It's actually not that we want it, but it is so easy, so accessible, it's already on our phone which makes it difficult to not access it, and already hard to resist as it quickly became daily habit without even noticing it. The industry behind social media wants more clicks, more time on site, higher conversation rates. We on the other hand don't tend to define another 20 minutes on social media as a step towards our ideal lives, but we check our phones again, and again, and again...

There are many reasons for this, but one of the main is defined by our need for the smartphone as a helpful companion, it makes many traditional tasks easier (taking notes, setting up reminders, using maps for navigation, translating content...). We started being more dependent on it, it's always there when we need it, but we also allowed it to interrupt us without our approval. If there is a notification (and there will be by default, because that's one of the simplest tricks to increase usage), we must at least look at it and dismiss. Industry uses this possibility to drag us back, to check our phone again. And we will, we have this fear of missing things out, which makes us addicted as a consequence.

## The Consequences

The potential for negative effects of social media on mental health in young kids and teens is warned by the American Academy of Pediatrics [^1], and they are not alone [^2]. The same risks may be true for adults too [^3]. Researches and surveys are countless, and this is becoming the hot topic worldwide. Statistical numbers also shows anxiety and depression is increasing, and social media is to blame [^4].

In addition, as a natural consequence comes the lack of time for the things that are important. Spending time with the family and friends is interrupted or sacrificed by increased attention that smartphone and all the virtual world in it suddenly "deserved". We don't realize how expensive social media overconsumption is, try to [measure it](https://www.rescuetime.com/rp/umpirsky), you will be horrified when you see and deeply understand your daily habits.

I often hear people complaining about the lack of time to do important stuff, yet they spend hours each day on social media. Of course, you can do it in the train, toilet, supermarket queue...but it still creates distraction, makes you tired and less capable to focus. This means lower productivity, especially dangerous if you are a student.

Another important effect that is noticed is how social media affects the way people think. It uses the same mechanism other traditional media like television and press already use successfully for years. It messes with our ability to think independently. Think about it, we already agree with people we follow. When we post a poll on Twitter, we are asking questions to people who think and share similar values with us, we can't expect fresh opinions about the subject, and yet that's why we posted it.

Smartphone overuse may also increase the risk of eye damage, posture [^5] and respiratory function [^6].

It's not only about mental and physical health, **privacy** is at risk too. Social networks collect huge amount of consumer data, the average user spends two and a half hours daily on social media [^7], and this activity reveals a great deal about them.
And like that's not enough, we share our private lives without thinking twice, it's promoted as a lifestyle. With a little detective work, anyone can reconstruct daily behavior of average social media user, knowing when and what places he went, who were his companions, what did he do, buy, eat and so on.

Even if we care about privacy, our options are limited. We use tools that collect information, we are surrounded with people who share, we live in a hyperconnected world and lack of privacy is the price we all have to pay. If we don't pay with money, we will **pay with our data**.

To finalize my thoughts on consequences, I caught myself doing wrong things, talking to other people and doing some research, I realized I'm not alone. This includes bad habits such as sharing news without reading past the headlines or sending smiley without moving my mouth.

> I mean, if I'm not smiling, why am I sending that emoticon?

There is no single reason I can point my finger at, but the background for such behavior can be found in a need for simple and quick reactions. To fake a smile in real life, you need to make effort, and probably some acting skills to make it look real. But not online, emotional reactions are cheap here.
