title: Finding the Focus in the Age of Distraction
---

One of the biggest problems in a hyperconnected world we live in is constant **distraction**. Usually caused by social media easily accessible on smartphones. It's highly addictive and brings false sense of connection. It usually leads to decreased productivity, has negative effects on **mental health** and could even lead to symptoms of depression.

## The Problem

Admit it or not, we all have it to some extent. The fact that you are reading this article now, means that either you or someone you care about is having this problem, or you just consume the content that someone shared with you.

As the number of internet users grows, grows the number of content creators, there are a number of websites that offer user-created content of many kinds. It sounded like a good idea, it still is, one of the best examples is probably [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). But since the growth was fast, and many of us were not ready or educated to cope with all this information overload available, we started to consume whatever seemed interesting, **mindlessly scroll** through social media as a daily life routine, always hungry for more.

Curiosity, the hunger, thirst, desire, need for knowledge and the exploration of the unknown is built into our DNA. It came natural that we want to explore the vast of information and content that was suddenly lying under our fingertips.

Same applies to content creation. We are social beings, we love to share, and technology allowed us to be able to **share** like never before. What was the privilege of a few, became available to the masses. Ordinary man was suddenly able to reach millions in a heartbeat.

The addiction builds up quickly, as we discover more, we want more. It's actually not that we want it, but it is so easy, so accessible, it's already on our phone which makes it difficult to not access it, and already hard to resist as it quickly became daily habit without even noticing it. The industry behind social media wants more clicks, more time on site, higher conversation rates. We on the other hand don't tend to define another 20 minutes on social media as a step towards our ideal lives, but we check our phones again, and again, and again...

There are many reasons for this, but one of the main is defined by our need for the smartphone as a helpful companion, it makes many traditional tasks easier (taking notes, setting up reminders, using maps for navigation, translating content...). We started being more dependent on it, it's always there when we need it, but we also allowed it to interrupt us without our approval. If there is a notification (and there will be by default, because that's one of the simplest tricks to increase usage), we must at least look at it and dismiss. Industry uses this possibility to drag us back, to check our phone again. And we will, we have this fear of missing things out, which makes us addicted as a consequence.
