One of the biggest problems in a hyperconnected world we live in is constant **distraction**. Usually caused by social media easily accessible on smartphones. It's highly addictive and brings false sense of connection. It usually leads to decreased productivity, has negative effects on **mental health** and could even lead to symptoms of depression.

## The Problem

Admit it or not, we all have it to some extent. The fact that you are reading this article now, means that either you or someone you care about is having this problem, or you just consume the content that someone shared with you.

As the number of internet users grows, grows the number of content creators, there are a number of websites that offer user-created content of many kinds. It sounded like a good idea, it still is, one of the best examples is probably [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/). But since the growth was fast, and many of us were not ready or educated to cope with all this information overload available, we started to consume whatever seemed interesting, **mindlessly scroll** through social media as a daily life routine, always hungry for more.

Curiosity, the hunger, thirst, desire, need for knowledge and the exploration of the unknown is built into our DNA. It came natural that we want to explore the vast of information and content that was suddenly lying under our fingertips.

Same applies to content creation. We are social beings, we love to share, and technology allowed us to be able to **share** like never before. What was the privilege of a few, became available to the masses. Ordinary man was suddenly able to reach millions in a heartbeat.
